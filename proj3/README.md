# Research Project 3: Heap Merging

This project requires you to implement Merge operation on ordinary
heaps, leftist heaps, and skew heaps.  You are to analyze and compare
the performances of a sequence of merges on these heap structures.

The size of input can be taken from 1000 to 10000.  The run times must
be plotted with respect to the sizes to illustrate the difference.
