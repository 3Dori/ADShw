# Research Project 3: Heap Merging

This project requires you to implement Merge operation on ordinary
heaps, leftist heaps, and skew heaps.  You are to analyze and compare
the performances of a sequence of merges on these heap structures.

The size of input can be taken from 1000 to 10000.  The run times must
be plotted with respect to the sizes to illustrate the difference.

## Assignment specification

**Programming**: Implement Merge on ordinary heaps, leftist heaps, and
 skew heaps (6 pts.).  Write a test of performance program (3 pts.).
 All the codes must be sufficiently commented.

**Testing**: Provide the necessary inputs for testing and give the run
 time table (2 pts.).  Plot the run times vs. input sizes for
 illustration (2 pts.).  Write analysis and comments (3 pts.).

**Documentation**: Chapter 1 (1 pt.), Chapter 2 (2 pts.), and finally
 a complete report (1 point for overall style of documentation).

**I write ordinary heap merge operations and do all the tests.**
